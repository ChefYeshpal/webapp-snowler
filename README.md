What is this?
This project is made for week 13 of [siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), where the theme is "Winter".
Here, the user is lost after a snowstorm. They seem to be in a pine forest, their agenda? get to civilization...


## A list...
- [ ] Background
    - [ ] Should be off-white
    - [ ] Have custom built snow covered pine trees?
    - [ ] maybe a path or something
    - [ ] Probaby make a png for this bro...
- [ ] Text should type out to introduce what's happening
    - [ ] Explain the scenario
        - *You wake up, your body covered in snow, as you somehow wriggle out of it's icy depths. Good thing you're wearing a thick jacket, otherwise hypothermia would have set in... Not like it can't right now, but you should retain body heat somehow...*


## Storyline
```
*You wake up, your body covered in snow, as you somehow wriggle out of it's icy depths. Good thing you're wearing a thick jacket, otherwise hypothermia would have set in... Not like it can't right now, but you should retain body heat somehow...*
*You see a path in front of you, going through the pine trees. It looks oddly deserted, but maybe there could be civilization out there?*
[Scourage for logs] [Walk the path]
