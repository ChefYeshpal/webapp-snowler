# webapp-snowler

## What is this?
This project is made for week 13 of [siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), where the theme is "Winter". This project is kind of (actually very) similar to my [week 5 project](https://github.com/ChefYeshpal/webapp-moneymaker/) but the only thing that's changed is that this is more "snow like" and doesn't have any of those pesky coin mechanics. That being said, I *have* made this from the ground up and literally haven't used any previous code from the other project, other than the ones I remember cause of experience :p

This is a text-based interactive "game" wherein **you** the **user** find themselves lost in the snow. You get choices on what you choose, and depending on how good they are you can either die or get rescued. Not much else really...
