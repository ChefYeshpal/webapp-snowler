# webapp-snowler

## What is this?
This project is made for week 13 of [siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), where the theme is "Winter". This project is kind of (actually very) similar to my [week 5 project](https://github.com/ChefYeshpal/webapp-moneymaker/) but the only thing that's changed is that this is more "snow like" and doesn't have any of those pesky coin mechanics. That being said, I *have* made this from the ground up and literally haven't used any previous code from the other project, other than the ones I remember cause of experience :p

The main premise of this game is that the "you" wake up buried in snow, wriggling out of it, you look around and notice that there isn't a sign of life anywhere. You can take pre-defined paths and maybe get to safely, or maybe you get to experience the extremem cringeness I've added to this.

        - *You wake up, your body covered in snow, as you somehow wriggle out of it's icy depths. Good thing you're wearing a thick jacket, otherwise hypothermia would have set in... Not like it can't right now, but you should retain body heat somehow...*
