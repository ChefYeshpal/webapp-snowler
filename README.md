## What is this?
This project is made for week 13 of [siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), where the theme is "Winter". This project is kind of (actually very) similar to my [week 5 project](https://github.com/ChefYeshpal/webapp-moneymaker/) but the only thing that's changed is that this is more "snow like" and doesn't have any of those pesky coin mechanics. That being said, I *have* made this from the ground up and literally haven't used any previous code from the other project, though it was kind of easier because I knew what I was doing this time

This is a text-based interactive "game" wherein **you** the **user** find themselves lost in the snow. You get choices on what you choose, and depending on how good they are you can either die or get rescued. Not much else really...

I know this game seems to be kind of simple, but last week i'd done 16 hours and this week I was kind of busy with some festivities. Hence why I choose a rather simple topic where I'd be a bit more experienced in whatever I'm doing.

I understood the "choice selection" mechanics from my [week 8 project: magic 8 ball](https://ChefYeshpal.github.io/webapp-magic8ball) and typing and story mechanics from [week 5 project: moneymaker](https://ChefYeshpal.io/webapp-moneymaker), so this could be considered an amalgamation of them both maybe?

Anyways, thanks for checking this out, ily :>
