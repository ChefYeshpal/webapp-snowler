    'You brush the frost from your jacket as you pull yourself free, breath fogging in the brittle air.',
    'Looking around, you notice you are standing in a snowy pine forest, rows of dark trunks fading into white.',

    'You look around, and all you see are the tall trees and the endless snow',

    'Or, you could try to get a fire going here and wait for help to arrive...',
    'What will you do?'
